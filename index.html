            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="section-content">My name is Ayoola Oluwadamilola Ayoshile. I am a BSc holder in Mathematics and a new frontend developer who has had ups and downs in life, from family background to educational struggles, both financially and in my studies. When I say family background, I do not mean I come from a problematic family but a family that has been financially handicapped ever since I lost my father at a young age. He was the sole breadwinner of the family, so the family burden fell on my mother. I won't blame her for this; dealing with the heartbreak of losing her husband so early in their marriage and having to take care of her five children has not been easy. At the time of his death, she also had a small baby, and I was just three years old.</p>
            <p class="section-content">I am sorry for laying out some of my life story here. It is not my intention to burden you with my struggles but to make you understand where I am coming from so you wonâ€™t be surprised by the kind of ambition I have for myself. I want to make my family financially stable again after more than two decades since my father's death.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Goals in the Tech Field</h2>
            <p class="section-content">First, I want to hone my skills in tech more with the help of HNG because competition makes one better in whatever we are doing in life. From there, I know if I can be diligent in my studies and put in the effort needed to be top in this internship, it will put me ahead in the tech market space. This internship will provide employment opportunities and exposure in the tech field; all I need to do is stay up to date with my work.</p>
            <p class="section-content">After excelling in this internship, I will keep building my portfolio. When job opportunities come, I will be able to showcase my skills through my portfolio because employers can only know who you are through your portfolio and media presence, which I also hope to grow in the next two years. Not to sound too ambitious, but I also want to build myself in the backend space along the way because I know there are fewer people in the backend space. However, this will be after becoming well-equipped with frontend development, as tech companies are looking for people who are diverse in knowledge.</p>
            <p class="section-content">Becoming top in this internship or not will not stop me from continuing my pursuit in the tech space because I see this as a way of lifting my family out of financial problems.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="section-content">In conclusion, if I can become a big name in the frontend space in two years, even if the jobs have not started coming by then, I know with my continued effort and work, they will surely come. With God's power, HNG will give me an advantage in this aspect. To summarize, I want to be among the top students in the HNG internship first, which comes down to how well I do in my frontend studies and the tasks I am given. Then, I hope to build a strong portfolio to give me an edge in job opportunities. Additionally, I want to gain knowledge in the backend space, as there are limited people in this area, giving me an edge in job seeking. To be clear, this will be after a year from now because doing two things at a time can negatively affect one's studies.</p>
